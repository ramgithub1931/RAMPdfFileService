Installation
1. Create a watcher directory somewhere on the machine, doesn't matter where.
2. Open the config.json file and enter that directory as the WatcherDirectory. (ex. C:\\users\\akrause\\rpfs)
   This is the directory where the RAMPdfFileService will watch for new folders and process them.
3. Open a command prompt and navigate to this directory (the one where the .exe is)
   This is where the service will actually live so it's probably best to not just have this sitting on your desktop.
4. Type the command 'installutil rampdffileservice.exe'
   This will actually install the service on your machine.
   If at any point you need to uninstall the service, type 'installutil rampdffileservice.exe \u'
5. Open the task manager and open the Services tab.  You should now see RAMPdfFileService on there.  Right click, start service.
   After starting the service you should now see a backup, errors and work directory inside the watcher directory from step 2.
6. The service should now be up and running.  Just drop folders in there and it should do it's thing.

Errors
The service currently uses windows logs to log errors and other things.  If you open the Event Viewer and expand 'Applications and
Services Logs' you should see a RAMPdfFileServiceLog.  In it should at the very least have an Information log telling you that the
service was started and the parameters given from the config.json file.
